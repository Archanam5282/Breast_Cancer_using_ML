## Project Title: 
Breast Cancer diagnosis using Machine Learning Model

## Project Description:
There are 2 types of cancer, one is Benign and other is Malignent.
Malignent is most dangerous one. Early diagnosis of this cancer significantly increases the chances of survival. 
Machine learning models give more accuracy than doctors in diagnosis of cancer. 
So we are classifying the 2 types of cancer.

1)Data from Kaggle website is used. The dataset consists of variables that has the values of features of cancer images.

2)The dataset is divinded into test and train(80-20)

3)Three machine learning models are used to train the test data. SVM, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.

4)Two evaluation methods are used, Confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve to evaluate the model
The code for each step is explained below.

## Prerequisites:
Install Jupyter notebook or Spyder for easy python programming

##Packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz
from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO 
from IPython.display import Image 
#from pydot import graph_from_dot_data
from sklearn import metrics
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')



## Steps to run the code:
Order of the code : 
1) Data_Exploration
2) Support_vector_machine
3) Improving SVM Model
4) Logistic_Regression
5) Logistic Regression improvement
6) DecisionTree
7) Improving Decision tree model
8) ROC curve of best 3 models

### Explaining each code:
1) Data_Exploration

  Download the dataset from the link :https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

  Import the file into juyter

  Check the null values, if any value is not numeric then make it as zero-numeric

  Changing the diagnosis column to 0 and 1 instead of M and B (Malignant and Benign) for future use. Delete the string column and keep the numeric column

  Split for 0 and 1 is shown

  All the 30 features scatter plot is shown

  Correlation is shown for all the 30 features

2) Support_vector_machine

  Here first, the dataset is split into Test and Train data (80-20%)

  Further, from the Trian and Test data, diagnosis column is seperated. 

  There will be 4 datatsets now. X_train, y_train, X_test,y_test. Dataset with X will have all features and dataset y will have diagnosis column only.

  SVC is used to fit the model for X_train and y_train.

  Then prediction is done for X_test using svc_predict.

  Theb the results of predicted value and y_test are compared. 

  Confusion matrix is plotted using the fuction

  Accuracy, Precision and Recall of model is shown using the in-built function

3) Improving SVM Model

  The data is standadised to [0,1] range and again trained anf tested the model. 

  Next, c and gamma values are changed for the model. This is done by using a funtion to get the optimised value.

  Again the model is trained and tested. Confusion matrix is run for both the improvement methods

4) Logistic_Regression

  Here first, the dataset is split into Test and Train data (80-20%)

  Further, from the Trian and Test data, diagnosis column is seperated. 

  There will be 4 datatsets now. X_train, y_train, X_test,y_test. Dataset with X will have all features and dataset y will have diagnosis column only.

  Logistic regression function is used to fit the model for X_train and y_train.

  Then prediction is done for X_test using predict.

  Theb the results of predicted value and y_test are compared. 

  Confusion matrix is plotted using the fuction

  Accuracy, Precision and Recall of model is shown using the in-built function

5) Improving Logistic Model

  The data is standadised to [0,1] range and again trained anf tested the model. 

  Second improvement is done by changing the weights and running the model with new weights obtained from the function

6) DecisionTree

  Here first, the dataset is split into Test and Train data (80-20%)

  Further, from the Trian and Test data, diagnosis column is seperated. 

  There will be 4 datatsets now. X_train, y_train, X_test,y_test. Dataset with X will have all features and dataset y will have diagnosis column only.

  Decision Tree function  is used to fit the model for X_train and y_train.

  Then prediction is done for X_test using svc_predict.

  Theb the results of predicted value and y_test are compared. 

  Confusion matrix is plotted using the fuction

  Accuracy, Precision and Recall of model is shown using the in-built function

7) Improving Decision tree model

  Hyper parameters are changed to get the optimised parameters by using the scikit learn function

  The model is trained and tested with the new models

8) ROC curve of best 3 models

  To compare the results of all 3 models, I created a loop to run the 3 best models. With this resukts, I plotted a single ROC-AUC curve
